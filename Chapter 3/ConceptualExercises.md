# Chapter 3 Conceptual Exercises

1. The null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. The table shows least squares coefficient estimates of the multiple linear regression of number of units sold on TV, radio and newspaper advertising budget. This corresponds to the Advertising dataset.
   The p-value for each predictor (TV, radio, newspaper) correspond to the null hypotheses $H_0$: *"There is **no** relashionship between the predictor (TV, radio or newspaper) and the amount of sales, while keeping the other predictors fixed"*.
   Mathematically, for a model like $sales=\beta_0+\beta_1\times TV+\beta_2\times radio + \beta_3\times newspaper$, the null hypotheses for the TV p-value would be $\beta_1 = 0$.
   By looking at the p-values in the table, one can conclude that TV and radio have p-values significantly low, meaning the null hypotheses can be rejected in favour of the alternative hypotheses, which means there is a relation between sales and TV and radio budgets.
   On the other hand, the p-value associated with newspaper is significantly high, meaning that there is no clear relashionship between newspaper budget and sales.
